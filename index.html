      <p>My name is Roy Lin, the Co-founder of <a href="http://credarp.com">Credarp Inc,</a> founded by Brian, Labrada and me at November 2013. We build web applications and iOS apps and are runing the product:<br/><a href="http://elbum.in">elbum</a>, Moneyball for basketball </p><br/>

      <p>I'm also the founder of <a href="http://dreamersday.tw">Dreamers' Day</a>, which is the biggest student startup community in Taiwan.&nbsp Brian and I started it because we believed that students should have entrepreneurship.&nbspThere were 5 demo shows and 20 meetups both in Taipei and Tainan, and over 300 students participated in.</p><br/>
